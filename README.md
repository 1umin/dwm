# dwm
 Personal config for dwm suckless dynamic window manager for X. This config provides few patches that most dwm user had.

## Patched ##

fullgaps* - Provide spacing around the windows.

alwayscenter* - Every pop-up window will be aligned at the center.

pertag*  - Gives the ability to choose which mode you want to imply to each tag. Also the dimension for each mode would be the same despite being used by different tags.
