# dwm
dwm is a dynamic window manager for X. It manages windows in tiled, monocle and floating layouts. All of the layouts can be applied dynamically, optimising the environment for the application in use and the task performed.

## Patched ##

fullgaps* - Provide spacing around the windows.

alwayscenter* - Every pop-up window will be aligned at the center.

pertag*  - Gives the ability to choose which mode you want to imply to each tag. Also the dimension for each mode would be the same despite being used by different tags.
